# Architecture Plans

## WIFI PLAN1

### System Architecture

![WIFI-PLAN1](./.img/WIFI-PLAN1.png)

### Devices
 - Raspberry Pi
 - VPS
 - NodeMCU
 - WiFi Router
 - ESP8266 /ESP-01/ D1 MINI / NodeMCU

### Features
 - Provide HTTP and Websocket API (Easy for App and Website Dev)
 - Provide History Data Access
 - API can be accessed from Internet
 - Ground Sensor network is flexible
 - Ground Sensor Network is low power
 - A NodeMCU collect data from air sensors and Ground Sensor Network and publish them through MQTT
 - The Cloud Server subscribe sensors through MQTT
 - The Cloud Server publish command through MQTT
 - The NodeMCU subscribe command subject through MQTT

### Advantages
 - Devices Easy to buy
 - Community support
 - Make full use of Existing Devices
 - Most of us are already familiar with WiFi and ESP8266
 - Cheap

### Shortages
 - WiFi is a HIGH Frequency Tech and may not suitable for farming iot
 - Cellular network may be unstable when there are huge number of nodes
 - Energy Comsumption is still a problem
 - Few papers for ESP8266 in Cellular Network

## LoRa PLAN1

### System Architecture

 - VPS
 - LoRa Gateway
 - LoRa Clients


### Features
 - Work on low frequency
 - LoRa Eco perfectly support MQTT
 - Can be implemented in real farms

### Advantages
 - Low Power
 - Stability had been proved
 - Cheap client Module
 - 10km+ effective radius

### Shortages
 - Cost a lot for buying LoRa Gateway (ï¿¥1000)
 - Few Community Support
 - Hard to purchase in market

## WIFI PLAN2

### System Architecture
